Description:
For loops in Python are used to iterate over sequences (lists, tuples, strings) or other iterable objects.
They provide a simple way to execute a block of code for each item in a sequence.
Python's for loops are actually foreach loops that iterate over items directly.

Snippet:
# Basic for loop with list
for item in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(item)

# Using range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Loop with enumerate()
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

# Nested loops
for x in range(3):
    for y in range(2):
        print(f"({x}, {y})")

# Loop with break and continue
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break
    if num % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(num)
