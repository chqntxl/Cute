Description:
While loops in Python execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a given condition is true.
They are used when you don't know the exact number of iterations needed beforehand.
The loop continues until the condition becomes false or a break statement is encountered.

Snippet:
# Basic while loop
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(counter)
    counter += 1

# While loop with else
num = 0
while num < 3:
    print(num)
    num += 1
else:
    print("Loop completed!")

# Break statement
count = 0
while True:
    if count >= 5:
        break
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Continue statement
i = 0
while i < 5:
    i += 1
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
