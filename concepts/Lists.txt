Description:
A list in Python is a mutable, ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. It is one of the most commonly used data structures, enabling easy storage and manipulation of multiple values.
Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`, and they can contain elements of different data types, including numbers, strings, and even other lists.
Python provides various built-in methods to perform operations on lists, such as adding, removing, sorting, and searching elements efficiently.
Lists support indexing and slicing, making them highly flexible for handling data.

Snippet:
# Creating a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Accessing elements by index
print(my_list[0])  # First element
print(my_list[-1]) # Last element

# Slicing a list
print(my_list[1:4]) # Elements from index 1 to 3

# Modifying an element
my_list[2] = 10

# Adding elements
my_list.append(6)  # Adds at the end
my_list.insert(2, 15)  # Inserts 15 at index 2

# Removing elements
my_list.remove(4)  # Removes the first occurrence of 4
popped_item = my_list.pop()  # Removes the last element and returns it
del my_list[1]  # Deletes element at index 1

# Finding elements
print(my_list.index(10))  # Returns index of first occurrence of 10
print(3 in my_list)  # Checks if 3 exists in the list

# Sorting and reversing
my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in ascending order
my_list.reverse()  # Reverses the list

# Iterating through a list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

# Copying a list
copy_list = my_list.copy()

# Clearing all elements from the list
my_list.clear()
