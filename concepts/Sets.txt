Description:
A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are mutable, but can only contain immutable elements.
Sets are particularly useful for removing duplicates from sequences and performing mathematical set operations.
They are defined using curly braces {} or the set() constructor.

Snippet:
# Creating a set
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
empty_set = set()  # Empty set

# Adding elements
my_set.add(6)  # Add single element
my_set.update([7, 8, 9])  # Add multiple elements

# Removing elements
my_set.remove(6)  # Raises error if not found
my_set.discard(7)  # No error if not found
popped = my_set.pop()  # Remove and return arbitrary element

# Set operations
set1 = {1, 2, 3}
set2 = {3, 4, 5}
union = set1 | set2  # Union
intersection = set1 & set2  # Intersection
difference = set1 - set2  # Difference
symmetric_diff = set1 ^ set2  # Symmetric difference

# Set comprehension
evens = {x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
